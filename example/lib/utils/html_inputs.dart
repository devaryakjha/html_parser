      '\n<p>The ‘USD—Yen’ carry trade has been all over the news lately. The term ‘Carry trade’ may come across as a fancy new trading technique, especially to newbies to the capital market, but carry trades have prevailed in the market for decades and were particularly popular in the 1990s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is your quick guide to bring you up to speed with the current Yen-USD carry trade hype.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start from scratch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every country is different and has its own political and economic problems. Countries devise unique ways to solve their local problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at just the economic problems in isolation, then the problem eventually boils down to two things—either a country is fighting inflation, where the prices of goods and services are increasing by the day, or the country is chasing growth, where it wants to produce more of its breadwinners to register higher incomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what the country wants (economically), they do so by tweaking the interest rates in the economy. For instance, if a country is fighting inflation, it will try to keep the interest rate high so that the circulation of money in the economy is tightened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the country is chasing growth, it will keep the interest rate low to make access to money cheaper to fuel growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, different countries have different interest rates in the economy. It&#8217;s the job of the central bank to determine the country&#8217;s economic needs, set interest rates, and monitor it regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a direct correlation between the interest rate and currency movements. If inflation is high, that means something is fundamentally wrong in the economy, and therefore, the central bank tends to increase the interest rate. Such currencies usually depreciate over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, the currency backed by low interest rates in the economy is considered to be doing well or a strong currency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this is where things get interesting &#8211; as long as the interest rates between two countries differ, there is a scope for ‘carry trade’. Let us say Country A has a low interest rate, and Country B has a high interest rate. Broadly speaking, a carry trade can be executed in the following manner &#8211;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Borrow funds at low interest rates from Country A</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Convert the borrowed funds into the currency of Country B&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Invest the converted funds into assets of Country B, usually the short-term sovereign bonds issued by Country B </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wait for the maturity of bonds&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Upon maturity, square off the trade</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Convert the proceeds back to the currency A&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Repay the borrowed funds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pocket the interest rate differential&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea behind this trade is that you earn the interest rate differential by virtue of ‘carrying’ the asset belonging to the country with the higher interest rate. Of course, institutions with larger risk appetites can deviate from Govt bonds and T-bills and venture into stocks, commodities, and corporate bonds. Most institutions do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, these carry trades seem to have done well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="957" height="509" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385517" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD.png 957w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-300x160.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-768x408.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The graph above shows the performance of carry trade in G10 currencies, and the index is called &#8220;Bloomberg GSAM FX Carry Index&#8221;. You can google it and compare it against stock indices to see relative performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what can go wrong here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will talk about the risks shortly, but to begin with, the implicit assumption here is that the costs of executing a carry trade are not prohibitive. The costs of a carry trade include the cost of borrowing,  conversion charges, settlement charges, banker’s fees, taxes, and lastly, brokerage. The carry trade should generate enough profits to pay off all these charges and still be profitable. For this reason, many carry trade opportunities appear profitable on paper but may not work out if you were to factor in the actual cost of running the carry trade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a carry trade to work, the interest rate differential should be large, like the Yen—USD carry trade that exists now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of July 2024, the interest rate in Japan is near zero, thanks to the prolonged deflationary economic environment, and the rate in the US is around 5.25% to 5.5%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forex traders borrow in Japanese Yen at near zero percent, convert to USD, invest in short-term US-denominated bonds and t-bills, upon maturity, convert back to Yen, repay, and pocket the interest rate differential.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the largish interest rate spread, the Yen-USD carry trade can easily absorb the costs. However, apart from costs, there are a few systemic risks involved in carry trade:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>The economic winds can change overnight, and interest rates can fluctuate. Remember 2020, covid era?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Changes in Govt policies or political affiliations&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Changes in interest rates impact currency rates. A weaker currency can strengthen, and a stronger currency can depreciate at the same time.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Speculations on economic prospects lead to currency volatility, thereby increasing the mark-to-market losses.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Changes in currency rates can impact the profitability of the carry trade.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>So much so that carry trade can result in losses. Perhaps that’s why traders talk about picking up pennies before a steam roller in the context of carry trade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, whenever traders talk about carry trade, the 1998 Yen-USD saga is recounted. Back in Oct 1998, within a week, the Japanese Yen rose 17% against the USD, meaning the Japanese Yen strengthened while the USD weakened. In other words, the JPY-USD currency pair cracked 17%.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-1998.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="477" height="412" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-1998.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385518" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-1998.png 477w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-1998-300x259.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Years of profitability in the Yen-USD carry trade were crushed within that one week. All profits were wiped clean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming back to the present day, similar sentiments are triggered in the carry trade world with the recent JPY-USD movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-31-Jul.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="490" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-31-Jul-1024x490.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385519" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-31-Jul-1024x490.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-31-Jul-300x144.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-31-Jul-768x368.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JPYUSD-31-Jul.png 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The USD-JPY pair cracked nearly 7% in July 2024, backed by the possible interest hike by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and perhaps a rate cut by the US Fed. The decision of both BOJ and the US Fed is expected around the last week of July 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, how does the carry trade impact you, your investments, and the world markets?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, institutions have borrowed trillions of Yen and channeled the funds across various emerging markets. Any distress in the carry Yen-USD trade dynamics will imply that these institutions will have to wind up their risk-carrying trades, which means they will have to sell the ‘carry’ assets. Position unwinding will therefore lead to 2nd order effect across all markets.</p>\n';

All mistakes, of course, are our own.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-budget-for-continuity"><strong>A Budget for continuity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/subtext/its-the-economy-stupid-bad-june-rising">couple of weeks ago</a>, we wondered if the government’s Budget priorities would change, now that it was run by a coalition. Specifically, we thought there was an off-chance it would try loading up on politically attractive short-term expenses — either with borrowed money, running up its ‘<strong>fiscal deficit</strong>’, or by cutting down the money it allocates for its long-term ‘<strong>capital expenses</strong>’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, that didn’t come to be. At least this time around. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1456" height="976" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385467" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18.png 1456w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18-300x201.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18-1024x686.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18-768x515.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1456px) 100vw, 1456px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the budget was… really <em>responsible</em>? The government actually brought down its fiscal deficit target, to 4.9% of the GDP — 0.2% lower than the interim budget delivered less than six months ago. And this wasn’t just for appearances. The government isn&#8217;t simply inflating what it thinks it’ll earn this year and pretending to be in good financial shape; in fact, it&#8217;s made fairly reasonable assumptions for the revenues it&#8217;ll earn this year. If we maintain our current rate of growth, the government might actually make more tax money than it’s currently projecting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the amount it set aside for capital expenditure is the same as it did in the interim budget. That’s 17% more than last year. Compare that to the mere 6% increase in what it budgeted for short-term ‘revenue expenditure’. Clearly, little has changed. This Budget signals continuity from the last iteration of the Lok Sabha. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1456" height="961" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-385464" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7.jpeg 1456w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7-300x198.jpeg 300w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7-1024x676.jpeg 1024w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7-768x507.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1456px) 100vw, 1456px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if the government is bringing down its fiscal deficit, it basically plans to borrow less.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like its market borrowings will come down ~10% from what it projected in its interim budget, and from what it actually borrowed last year. This is great. Governments have a bad habit of ‘<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crowdingouteffect.asp">crowding out</a>’ everyone else when they borrow, taking up so much of the available money that it becomes harder (and more expensive) for everyone else to borrow any. This is a particularly big risk right now, with banks <a href="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/subtext/its-the-economy-stupid-everyone-wants-your-savings">barely having any money</a> to loan out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the government cuts down on its borrowing, going ahead, there’ll probably be some more money in the system for private borrowers to dig into. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1456" height="962" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-14.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385461" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-14.png 1456w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-14-300x198.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-14-1024x677.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-14-768x507.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1456px) 100vw, 1456px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stealthy-reforms"><strong>Stealthy reforms</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s some fantastic news that nobody is talking about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know how middle class tax-payers keep complaining about how most other Indians don’t pay their fair share of taxes? Annoying as that is, it really is a big problem. India’s income tax collections are <a href="https://www.ndtvprofit.com/opinion/2017/02/20/decoding-indias-low-tax-base-conundrum">unusually</a> low: partly because even the lowest tax bracket is higher than what most Indians make, partly because of other things. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1456" height="960" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-15.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385462" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-15.png 1456w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-15-300x198.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-15-1024x675.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-15-768x506.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1456px) 100vw, 1456px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the short-term, it’s really convenient for a politician to pull up the lowest tax bracket whenever you&#8217;re under some pressure — what do voters like more than not paying taxes, after all? But this distorts our entire fiscal system. In effect, it passes the bill for the government’s normal functioning to a tiny set of people. The way these incentives work, moreover, the point at which you have to start paying taxes — the &#8216;<strong>tax exemption limit</strong>&#8216; — can only shift upwards. <em>Lowering </em>the limit is political suicide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An unsung achievement of this government, but a big one nonetheless, is to fight this political urge. The last time it increased the tax exemption limit was ten years ago, in the 2014 post-election budget. If you come under the old tax regime, the tax exemption limit is still where it was set all those years ago — i.e., when your income hits ₹2.5 lakhs. If you’ve opted for the new regime, you need to start paying taxes once you earn ₹3 lakhs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s not all, is it? The limit has been kept the same yes, but in the meanwhile, inflation has been eating away at its value. Since 2014, we’ve faced an average of 5% inflation. Things cost 65% more than they did when these slabs were decided. So, while you’ve to start paying taxes at an income of ₹2.5/3 lakhs, that money means a lot less than it did in 2014. In real terms, the tax exemption limit has actually come <em>down</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1456" height="968" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-16.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385463" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-16.png 1456w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-16-300x199.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-16-1024x681.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-16-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1456px) 100vw, 1456px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This effect is evident from the graphs above. As a country, we’re paying more income tax than ever. In the decade between Fiscals 2015 and 2025, income tax collections grew from 2% of our GDP to 3.6% — a difference of 1.6%. For context, it had grown by just 1% in the preceding 35 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this, the burden of paying taxes is slowly shifting away from corporations to individuals. In Fiscal 2015, we were in a trough, with income tax collections 40% lower than corporate tax collections. This year, income tax collections are 15% higher than corporate tax collections. This is the best ratio we’ve had in decades (except for the single year of Fiscal 1998, when a tax amnesty scheme drove up collections.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1456" height="964" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-17.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385465" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-17.png 1456w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-17-300x199.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-17-1024x678.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-17-768x508.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1456px) 100vw, 1456px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of people paying their taxes has also gone up. We have data for upto Fiscal 2022, when almost 9 crore people paid their taxes (or filed their income tax returns, at least). This number had gone up 25% since 2017. By now, India almost certainly has over 10 crore tax payers. That’s over 10% of Indian adults, and more than 15% of India’s workforce. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a substantial improvement in India’s fiscal health. And it didn’t come from the government <em>doing </em>something: it came from the government <em>holding itself back</em> from increasing tax exemptions. Funny, huh?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-us-economy-chugs-along-just-fine"><strong>The US economy chugs along just fine</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have the first advance estimates for how much the GDP of the United States went up in the first quarter of June 2024. The result: its Real GDP grew at 2.8% between the quarters. That’s well over its 1.4% growth in the March quarter, and rather better than its average growth over the last few quarters. For all the unending drama, if you zoom out, things are chugging along just fine in the richest country in the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1456" height="976" src="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385466" srcset="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18.png 1456w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18-300x201.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18-1024x686.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/z-connect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-18-768x515.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1456px) 100vw, 1456px" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"/>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s all for the week, folks!</p>\n';

On the other hand, if Mrs. Verma has substantial wealth, including properties, investments, and a business, and wishes to manage these assets and provide for her family across generations, creating a trust would offer her greater control and protection for her assets.

By doing so, the assets in the trust are legally owned by the trust, not Mr. Patel. If Mr. Patel incurs personal liabilities or creditors pursue him for debts, the assets within the trust are protected and cannot be used to settle his personal liabilities. The assets remain intact and are used as intended for the beneficiaries, ensuring his children&#8217;s financial security.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The views and opinions expressed in this blog are those of the author.
